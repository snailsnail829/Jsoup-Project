"Jennifer", "Shoppers should know before buying that this vehicle becomes very loose with the screws. After use you HAVE to tighten the bars. Otherwise you'll be turning left and your wheel still be going straight. This will cause quick wear on the mechanisms. I'm going to get a refund. Positive note, the scooter is stylish.", "2 out of 5 stars review Verified Purchase Jennifer", "Not Verified", "", "", "", "54", "No Image", "No Video"
"Fischmom", "As a mother of four kids, we have owned our fair share of scooters! But this scooter is by far the best! It rolls super smooth and we love the larger wheels. I can actually fold this scooter (our others ones claimed to fold but you needed luck and some brute strength to do so) but this folds easily! You can tell it is made of quality material, too. My daughter loves the colors and that it has a kickstand! I love the kickstand because it is one less thing lying on the garage floor. As you can tell, I highly recommend this scooter!", "5 out of 5 stars review Verified Purchase Fischmom", "Not Verified", "12/19/2020", "", "", "104", "No Image", "No Video"

"Anna", "Great size for older kids. I would say it is kinda small for an adult. Bought it for my 10yo kid. Nice, sturdy, well made. Great price!

"Noel", "Very well designed and structured, nice colors, the only thing is that the little foot needed to be extended to balance the weight of the scooter.

"AMRIT", "It has a critical flaw and cannot stay open I try to Google, check on their website even emailed them didnt find any answer. I was about to return it but then finally figured it out.

"Magnumbull", "I read some of the reviews about people not being able to assemble it so they returned it. The instructions don't explain properly how to do it. I almost gave up too and then tried one last time. The secret to making it lockn into the upright position it to give it a jerking snap. With a quick motion of the wrist, the handlebars lock into place. I tried it again and again and that seems to be the method with the highest success rate. Otherwise, the board doesn't lock and stays grounded. The ride is smooth, the scooter is heavy and feels sturdy. Sometimes, I like to ride on it for a minute or two while my kid is on the swings. My 4 yr old rides this and she can't use the kickstand by herself, so it is definitely for larger and stronger ki...", "4 out of 5 stars review Verified Purchase Magnumbull", "Not Verified", "12/25/2020", "", "", "146", "No Image", "No Video"

"Mellissa", "The handle bars are wobbly there is no way to tighten them. I tried to and it just strips the bolts. The grip tape is peeling up right out of the box. Other than that itâ€™s an okay ride but it feels like I built it. Frame seems sturdy really like the folding feature much easier than other scooters.
